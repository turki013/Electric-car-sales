This document summarizes insights and observations derived from the visualizations in the project.

## 🔍 Scatter Plot Observations

* **China** had the highest total EV count, but the average (mean) was lower due to the long range of years with varying values.
* The **USA** and **Europe** had more balanced values across the years, leading to higher average points in the scatter plot.
* **Canada** had low total and average values in both sales and stock.

### Insight:

> A country with high total EV numbers can still show a low average if values were inconsistent or only spiked in recent years.

---

## 📊 Stacked Bar Chart Observations

* **China** had the largest total in both EV sales and stock, clearly dominating the chart.
* **Europe** followed as second in total volume.
* **USA** and **Canada** had smaller proportions.

### Insight:

> China’s dominance in EV is consistent when looking at total values (stacked), even if the average (scatter) appears lower.

## 📉 Regular Bar Chart (Sorted by Total Value)

* This chart gives a clear, sorted view of which region leads overall.
* **Sorting helped highlight Canada** as the lowest contributor across the dataset.

### Insight:

> Sorting gives fast insight into regional impact without the need to analyze values manually.

## 💡 Conclusion

* Use stacked bars to compare components (sales vs stock).
* Use scatter plots to analyze consistency across time.
* Use sorting to enhance data storytelling in static visuals.

This type of multi-view analysis gives both depth and clarity to the story hidden in your dataset.
